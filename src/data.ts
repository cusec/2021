      title: `How to Leverage Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the Vibrant Space Economy`,
      description: `Space – once considered the final frontier and only accessible to a select few – is now home to the most dynamic and innovative economy on the planet. Today every community, infrastructure, and aspect of modern life is either acutely dependent on or indirectly affected by space-related technologies. These innovations span health and medicine, transportation, public safety, consumer goods, industrial productivity, information technology, energy and environment, and more, impacting societies and regions across the globe.

<br />Opportunities abound, but it’s complicated. Beyond the abundance of possibilities presented by collaboration between public organizations and private enterprises, NASA and the Pentagon, there is a workforce and skills deficit in the space industry. Without manpower at every level – from non-STEM laborers to business entrepreneurs to STEM experts – and continual career upskilling to enable the commercialization of space technology innovations, the full potential of the space economy for the betterment of humanity will not be realized.

<br />Not every person will get to ride on a rocket, see one lift off, or build a satellite or payload, but every person can contribute to delivering space technology solutions that we depend on every day, like more accurate weather forecasting, new materials for manufacturing goods, advanced global communications, healthcare innovation, and precision farming. Shelli will share a pragmatic workforce development roadmap and five core disciplines for becoming a space innovator.`,

Further, companies themselves inherently function through collectives: from management itself, to surveillance of workers through HR, to trade organizations, to the Chamber of Commerce.

The reality is far worse, because robots literally embody many of the harms of AI in such a way as to institutionalize and reproduce the stereotypes and issues.

      title: `What frontend engineers really do (and why you might want to become one, too)`,
      description: `The world of frontend development encompasses everything you see and interact with on the web. From this talk, you'll gain a solid understanding of what frontend engineers do, and maybe even figure out whether this is a career path that appeals to you. I'll share insights from my 8+ years of working as a frontend engineer in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, with a focus on the following topics:

* The amazing evolution of frontend development (from static HTML pages to complex single-page applications)
* The unique challenges of building user interfaces for the modern web
* What differentiates frontend engineers from full-stack and backend engineers
* How to keep up with web trends
* What I find most rewarding (and fun!) about my work`,

      title: `There is NO Developer Uniform!`,
      description: `"No devs wear that!" "You're too pretty to be a dev" "Only real devs use Macs"

<br />When we wonder why there is no diversity in tech, these stereotypes and gatekeeping philosophies are part of the blame. Having heard them over and over in my own career, I've learned to resist the negativity that ensues from these thoughts.

<br />In this keynote talk, I'll share some personal bits of my own story in this industry, the hardships and prejudices I've faced, and the lessons I've learned to establish that success is more than possible. While going on this journey, we'll explore the many stereotypes that influence the way we think, how they impact our efforts on making the tech industry more diverse and inclusive, and see direct counterexamples to these baseless assumptions.

<br />By the end of this talk, I hope to dismantle these established, but harmful stereotypes and inspire the audience, no matter who they are, to believe that there truly is no developer uniform.`,
